# WeatherForecastApp
An Android weather application implemented using the MVVM pattern, Retrofit2, LiveData, ViewModel, 
Coroutines, Navigation Components, Data Binding and some other libraries from the Android Jetpack . 
Instant Weather fetches data from the MetaWeather API to provide real time weather information.

## Architecture
The architecture of this application relies and complies with the following points below:
* A single-activity architecture, using the [Navigation Components](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) to manage fragment operations.
* Pattern [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)(MVVM) which facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface.
* [Android architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/) which help to keep the application robust, testable, and maintainable.
